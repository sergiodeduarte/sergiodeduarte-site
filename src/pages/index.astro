            <p>14 years in marketing &amp; tech. Three countries. One focus: To Elevate Healthcare Services</p>
            <p>
              👋 Hey! I'm Sergio. I built and run a healthcare services OPS, recruiting &amp; client acquisition engine
              that helps independent, non-medical, private pay senior home care agencies doing $500K-$3M a year grow at
              scale – all in one platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't charge retainers. I don't charge project fees. I charge per result. Per client acquired, per
              caregiver recruited, per output delivered. If the system doesn't perform, I don't get paid. That's how
              much I trust what I build.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my journey, I moved to a new country with $400, no network, speaking a foreign language, and
              managed to close my first deals worth over $55,000.00 from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've lived in Dublin, moved across Canada, pitched investors in Sillicon Valley, and planting seeds in San
              Antonio, TX. I've started and failed over 4 startups and messed up big time. I also co-founded 2 English
              speaking Toastmasters clubs in a non-English-speaking country and was honoured to work with the MIT
              Enterprise Forum to grow the innovation, tech and science ecosystem. I'm embedded in this ecosystem because
              I genuinely love the opportunity to collaborate and contribute.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grateful to be an n8n builder and official Ambassador, building cool stuff running Claude Code on terminal
              and yet still learning javascript! Passionate to facilitate genuine conversations that turn into meaningful
              outcomes and experiences!

            <h3>Healthcare Automation</h3>
            <p>
              I build the engine that runs healthcare service businesses — lead capture, CRM workflows, provider
              matching, caregiver recruiting, and client follow-up. All automated. All HIPAA-aware. Powered by n8n,
              Claude Code, and HubSpot.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="work-card">
            <h3>Senior Care Focus</h3>
            <p>
              The USA senior care industry is massive and underserved by technology. I connect families with licensed
              home care agencies through systems that run 24/7 — from Google Ads to signed contracts, without a sales
              team.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="work-card">
            <h3>Community & Content</h3>
            <p>
              n8n Ambassador. Meetup organizer. I create content about real-world automation for service businesses —
              not toy demos, not hypotheticals. Systems I built, results they produced.
